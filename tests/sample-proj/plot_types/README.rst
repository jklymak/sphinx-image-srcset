Plot types
==========

This gallery lists many of the plotting commands in Matplotlib, 
(but not all of them!).

Note that we have stripped all labels, but they are present by default.  
See the `gallery <../gallery/index.html>`_ for many more examples and 
the `tutorials page <../tutorials/index.html>`_ for longer examples.
